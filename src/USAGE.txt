# USAGE

## Hardware Setup

1. Mount the MLX90640 thermal sensor and Pi Camera 2 side-by-side using the printed holder, ensuring they share the same field of view.
2. Connect both sensors to a Raspberry Pi 4.

## Running the System

1. Boot up the Raspberry Pi.
2. Navigate to the source code directory.
3. Set up environment using pip with requirement.txt
4. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python3 realTimeSR.py
   ```

## Interface Overview

- Real-time display of:
  - Raw thermal image.
  - Upscaled thermal image using bilinear interpolation (baseline).
  - Super-resolved thermal image (final output).
- The display updates continuously as new frames are processed.

## Controls

- Press `q`: Quit the application.

## Notes

- Ensure the Pi Camera and thermal sensor are calibrated and aligned before starting.
- Move the setup slightly between frames to introduce sub-pixel shifts for best results. (i.e. handheld should be fine)
