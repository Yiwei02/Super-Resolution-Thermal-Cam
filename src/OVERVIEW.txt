## General Theory of Operation

This project enhances the resolution of low-cost thermal cameras (MLX90640, 32x24 resolution) by applying Multi-Frame Super-Resolution (SR) techniques. The method fuses multiple low-resolution thermal frames, captured during slight hand movements, into a single higher-resolution thermal image. Motion between frames is estimated using a Pi Camera 2 (webcam) mounted beside the thermal camera. The relative motion is tracked in real-time, and corresponding thermal frames are aligned and combined using a fusion algorithm. The final result provides an upscaled thermal image (64x48 resolution) with reduced artifacts and improved detail compared to conventional interpolation techniques like bilinear interpolation.

## Source Code Structure

- **realTimeSR.py**: The main execution script. Handles initialization, video capture, motion tracking, frame alignment, and super-resolution image fusion.
- **./offlineSR **: folder for a basic demo, no hardware required, main script is fastSR.py
- **testthermalcamvis.py**: this is the thermal camera test script, test capturing video.
